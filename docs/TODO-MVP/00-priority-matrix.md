# Priority Matrix & Timeline

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-19  
**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Team Size**: 1-2 developers

## 🎯 Priority Levels

### P0 - CRITICAL (Blocks Production)
Must be fixed immediately. System is broken or unsafe.

### P1 - HIGH (Core Functionality)
Essential for MVP. Users cannot use product effectively without these.

### P2 - MEDIUM (Important Features)
Enhances user experience significantly. Should be done soon.

### P3 - LOW (Nice to Have)
Can wait until after MVP launch.

## 🚦 Decision Gates

### Gate 1: End of Day 2
**Question**: Are calculations working on backend?
- ✅ Yes → Continue to deployment
- ❌ No → All hands on backend until fixed

### Gate 2: End of Day 3
**Question**: Is deployment automated?
- ✅ Yes → Continue to database
- ❌ No → Fix deployment before proceeding

### Gate 3: End of Week 1
**Question**: Is system stable for testing?
- ✅ Yes → Begin enhancement sprint
- ❌ No → Extend critical fixes

### Gate 4: End of Week 2
**Question**: Ready for production?
- ✅ Yes → Deploy to production
- ❌ No → Identify blockers, plan hotfix

## 📊 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Calculation migration breaks frontend | High | Critical | Incremental migration with fallbacks |
| Deployment automation fails | Medium | High | Manual deployment as backup |
| TwelveData API changes | Low | High | Version lock, monitor deprecations |
| Test coverage too low | High | Medium | Focus on critical paths first |
| Performance regression | Medium | Medium | Benchmark before/after changes |

## 🎯 Success Criteria
