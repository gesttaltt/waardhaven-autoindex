# RIVL - Real-time Information Velocity & Latent Consensus Platform

## ⚠️ STATUS: CONCEPTUAL DOCUMENTATION - NOT IMPLEMENTED

## Overview
**This is a conceptual design document for a potential future evolution of the platform. None of the features described here are currently implemented.**

RIVL represents a potential future evolution of the Waardhaven AutoIndex platform into a sophisticated belief-revision intelligence system for institutional investors. This comprehensive documentation outlines the complete vision, architecture, and implementation strategy for transforming the current MVP into a market-leading investment intelligence platform.

## Vision Statement
**"We don't tell you what to buy; we show why consensus will change and link the proof."**

RIVL is designed to identify and quantify belief-revision opportunities in financial markets by detecting divergences between current market consensus and emerging evidence from multiple data sources.

## Documentation Structure

### 📋 [RIVL-ROADMAP.md](./RIVL-ROADMAP.md)
Complete 14-day implementation plan with day-by-day milestones, deliverables, and success metrics.

### 📊 Signal Generation (`/rivl-signals/`)
Detailed specifications for each belief-revision signal:
- **[DELTA-FILINGS.md](./rivl-signals/DELTA-FILINGS.md)** - Semantic analysis of SEC filing changes
- **[NOVELTY-VELOCITY.md](./rivl-signals/NOVELTY-VELOCITY.md)** - Information propagation and language arbitrage
- **[EARNINGS-TRUTH-METER.md](./rivl-signals/EARNINGS-TRUTH-METER.md)** - Audio prosody and text credibility analysis
- **[CONSENSUS-GAP.md](./rivl-signals/CONSENSUS-GAP.md)** - Market reaction vs. expected impact measurement

### 🏗️ Architecture (`/rivl-architecture/`)
- **[SYSTEM-DESIGN.md](./rivl-architecture/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md)** - Complete technical architecture with data flows, scalability considerations, and infrastructure requirements

### 🧠 Intelligence Models (`/rivl-models/`)
Advanced ML models for market intelligence:
- **[SURPRISE-INDEX.md](./rivl-models/SURPRISE-INDEX.md)** - KL divergence-based belief revision quantification
- **[REGIME-DETECTION.md](./rivl-models/REGIME-DETECTION.md)** - BOCPD and Bayesian nowcasting for market regime identification

### 📦 Evidence System (`/rivl-evidence/`)
- **[EVIDENCE-PACK-SYSTEM.md](./rivl-evidence/EVIDENCE-PACK-SYSTEM.md)** - Complete audit trail and attribution system with JSON schemas

### 🚀 Go-to-Market (`/rivl-differentiation/`)
- **[GO-TO-MARKET.md](./rivl-differentiation/GO-TO-MARKET.md)** - Comprehensive GTM strategy, pricing model, and competitive positioning

## Key Differentiators

### 1. **Belief-Revision Focus**
Unlike traditional data providers, RIVL focuses on identifying when and why market consensus is about to shift, not just providing raw data.

### 2. **Complete Evidence Transparency**
Every signal includes document-level attribution with links to source materials, timestamps, and calculation methodology.

### 3. **Language Arbitrage Capability**
Native processing of Portuguese, Spanish, and English provides 30-90 minute information advantages on emerging market events.

### 4. **Small/Mid-Cap Coverage**
Equal depth coverage for companies between $500M-$10B market cap, addressing an underserved market segment.

## Target Market

### Primary Customers
- **Mid-sized hedge funds** ($100M-$2B AUM)
