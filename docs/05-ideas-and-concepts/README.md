2. **Do not reference these as existing features** - They are future possibilities
3. **Implementation would require significant development** - Most concepts require weeks or months of work
4. **Some ideas may never be implemented** - They represent brainstorming and planning

## How to Use This Documentation

- **For Planning**: Use these documents to understand potential future directions
- **For Investors**: These represent the long-term vision, not current capabilities

## Contributing Ideas

When adding new conceptual documentation:
1. Clearly mark it as "CONCEPTUAL - NOT IMPLEMENTED"
2. Focus on business value and use cases
3. Include rough implementation estimates
4. Consider technical feasibility
5. Document potential challenges

## Implementation Priority

If/when these concepts move to implementation:
1. Evaluate current business needs
2. Assess technical dependencies
3. Consider implementation complexity
4. Review resource availability
5. Validate with user feedback
